#This question uses the wage21 data set, posted on the course webpage in several formats.

#Question 7
#Loading data into R
wage <- read.csv("http://online.sfsu.edu/mbar/ECON312_files/wage21.csv")

#7-c Estimate the modelâ€™s coefficients using OLS, and report the estimates b_1,b_2 . The commands in R are:
model1 <- lm(EARNINGS ~ S, data = wage) #OLS estimation
b <- coef(model1) #Storing the estimated coefficients in vector b
b  #Displaying the estimated coefficeints

#7-d Interpret the regression coefficients
summary(wage$S) #Summary statistics of Schooling

#7-e a.	Based on your estimates, what is your predicted hourly earnings for an individual with 16 years of schooling? 
EARN_pred <- b[1] + b[2]*16 #Calculating the prediction
EARN_pred #Display the prediction

#7-f Based on your estimates, what is your predicted hourly earnings for an individual with 20 years of schooling? 
EARN_pred <- b[1] + b[2]*20 #Calculating the prediction
EARN_pred #Display the prediction

#7-g Calculate and interpret the value of  in this model. Use the command summary(model1) in R. This gives a table with various statistics
summary(model1) #Display the estimation results

#7-h Plot the graph of actual values of EARNINGS vs S, and add the fitted equation
